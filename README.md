# Web Pokedex

## Libraries and frameworks
* React
* Vite
* Tailwind
* Typescript

I choose Vite over NextJS because I priorize lightweight over structure with small projects.

## Comments

This was my first time with typescript and react, so I had some difficulties trying to apply the logic.
My last time programming was 2 years ago on my last job, working with Laravel, despite that I prefer front-end development.

I really want to get into React, this was a really good opportunity to check the state of the art on web frameworks and also notice that I need some more experience too.
